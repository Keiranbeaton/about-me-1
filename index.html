    <h2>JAMES MOON</h2>

    <p>I'm born and raised in Seattle and love the city. In the past I've been involved in careers with automotive and banking. Both are great careers for people interested in sales or service type work. However, I'd prefer to have the freedom to create and that's why I'm making the shift to coding in hopes that I'll have that opportunity.</p>
